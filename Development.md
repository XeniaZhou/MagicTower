# Development
### first commit
I form the overall structure of my background, including coding classes for keys, gems and monsters.
The problem I encountered is how to form a background map with many elements like different doors, walls and roads. I created a enum to match them.
The next problem maybe how to form a dialog box when typing in name and talking with NPC.

### second commit
I make this project work! The character, which is the purple rectangle now, can move, take keys and gems, and defeat monsters. 
I struggled on the "refer" and "point" part for most of time to address the problem of changing data through functions and now I figure it out.
The remaining things are loading imagics to replace those reactangles and circles, add a NPC and store, and maybe add sounds to make it more like a game.
I am thinking about giving up the idea to make a choiable ending, because there are at most 5 floors where I cannot develop a complete story.

### third commit
As I developed this game, I found that the coin system is not necessary as it works in the same way as the gem, which just adds some ATK or DEF. I use ofxGif as 
an addon to help me finish the cg part of endings and dead. At the same time as adding more sounds to make this game not so boring, I add something not mentioned in Proposal
that when plaer combats monsters, there will be information of this monster and ask whether the player does want to duel it. We can also communicate with the NPC after this 
commit.
