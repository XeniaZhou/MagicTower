# Development
### first commit
I form the overall structure of my background, including coding classes for keys, gems and monsters.
The problem I encountered is how to form a background map with many elements like different doors, walls and roads. I created a enum to match them.
The next problem maybe how to form a dialog box when typing in name and talking with NPC.

### second commit
I make this project work! The character, which is the purple rectangle now, can move, take keys and gems, and defeat monsters. 
I struggled on the "refer" and "point" part for most of time to address the problem of changing data through functions and now I figure it out.
The remaining things are loading imagics to replace those reactangles and circles, add a NPC and store, and maybe add sounds to make it more like a game.
I am thinking about giving up the idea to make a choiable ending, because there are at most 5 floors where I cannot develop a complete story.
