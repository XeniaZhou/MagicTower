# Project Proposal
for my final project, I would like to create a 2D game which is similar with a series of games which is called
[**Tower of the Sorcerer**](http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA013374/game/egame0.html)

### About the Game
*Tower of the Sorcerer* is a 2D RPG game created by two Japanese people in 1998. Many other versions of this game came out after that.
My version of *Tower of the Sorcerer* is a RPG-style game as well. The hero needs to combat monsters, talk with the
unknown NPC to know the story and get keys to open the door to the next floor and save the princess. However, because 
of the time-consuming of collecting data, the kinds and numbers of monsters, equipments and mazes will reduce. 

###Details
- the game has:
 - five floors.
 - three kinds of keys.
 - five kinds of monsters.
 - two kinds of juwelry to increase the ATK or DEF.
 - first-aid.
 - HP, ATK, DEF system.
 - coin and exp system.
 - stores to purchase weapon.
 - an unknown NPC to talk with and understand the story.
 - a princess waiting for help.
 - choosable endings.
- the background is:
 - the player acts as a hero, enters a magic tower and combat monsters, unpuzzles the floor maze by get keys, and reach the fifth 
 floor to save the princess.


### Some Assignments that Help Me
- This game is logically similar with the **Adventure** assignment, so I may use some implementations from it, like the duel 
system. 
- It also will implement the idea of keyboard supervising in **of-snake** assignment so that the hero can move by control W, A, S, D
and accomplish some other functions like using I to check the items.

### Other LIbraries and Resources I may Use
- The [Boost Library](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_66_0.html).
 - this library contains regex, which is helpful for me to to match input for name.
 - it also contains graph library to create graphic characters of monsters.
- The GUI Library (maybe).
- also character graphs from the original *Tower of the Sorcerer*

### Requirements
- [x] The project will be a openFrameworks application.
- [x] Implement a windowed application.
- [x] Use a significant library that we do not cover in class.
